* [2020- ] Thesis co-director of [Lionel Tailhardat](https://genears.github.io/) for his PhD co-supervised with [Raphaël Troncy](https://www.eurecom.fr/~troncy/) ([EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr)), "Synergy between knowledge graphs and machine learning for the detection of anomalies"

## Students (past)
* [2020-2023] Thesis co-director of [Jixiong Liu](https://www.yansera.com/) for his PhD co-supervised with [Raphaël Troncy](https://www.eurecom.fr/~troncy/) ([EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr)), "Production and valorization of semantic annotation on structured datasets through a recommendation process based on graph embedding techniques"
   Here are the three main contributions of his PhD in few words + links:
   * [This journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1570826822000452) providing a fine grained classification of table types that one can harvest in the wild, on the Web and tools to pre-process them
   * A system for automatically interpreting tables based on a target knowledge graph. DAGOBAH has won the last 2 editions of the SemTab challenge. [API avalaible here](https://developer.orange.com/apis/table-annotation/overview)
   * A plugin system that leverages knowledge graph embeddings for improving the disambiguation step. [Open source](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/radar-station)
* [2020] Supervision of Antoine Py for his final year internship at [University De Franche-Comté](http://www.univ-fcomte.fr/), "Development of a Web application for annotation and semantic integration of tabular data"
* [2019] Supervision of [Jixiong Liu](https://www.yansera.com/) for his final year internship at [ESIGELEC Rouen](http://www.esigelec.fr/), "Implementation of a prototype for annotating tabular data using semantic models"
* [2018] Supervision of Nicolas Geist for his final year internship at [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/), "Development of a platform for detecting illegal activities using knowledge engineering and machine learning"
