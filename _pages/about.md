I am currently a researcher in the DATA-IA entity at [Orange](https://hellofuture.orange.com/) since 2014. 
I am leading several research and anticipation projects in the field of Knowledge Engineering and NLP.
I hold a PhD (2014) from the [University of Burgundy](http://www.ubfc.fr/) and the [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/).

My research focuses on the use of **knowledge engineering** in different application contexts:
* For characterization, research and recommendation and life cycle management of **datasets**.
* For the detection of illegal activities in the context of **cybersecurity** projects.

Enjoy your visit!
