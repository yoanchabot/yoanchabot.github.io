   Here are the three main contributions of his PhD in few words + links:
   * [This journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1570826822000452) providing a fine grained classification of table types that one can harvest in the wild, on the Web and tools to pre-process them
   * A system for automatically interpreting tables based on a target knowledge graph. DAGOBAH has won the last 2 editions of the SemTab challenge. [API avalaible here](https://developer.orange.com/apis/table-annotation/overview)
   * A plugin system that leverages knowledge graph embeddings for improving the disambiguation step. [Open source](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/radar-station)
