## Wikimedia
I have a strong interest in contributing to Wikimedia projects, with a particular focus on Wikidata. As an active contributor under the username [Metafire18](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Metafire18), I work on enhancing the quality and scope of the knowledge graph by adding structured data to a variety of topics. 

One of my current projects involves [enriching Wikidata with Star Wars-related information](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Star_Wars), specifically about planets, star systems, and sectors in the Star Wars universe. By integrating this data into the knowledge graph, I aim to make it more accessible and valuable for fans, researchers, and enthusiasts who seek to explore the vast and intricate galaxy of Star Wars through structured, interconnected data.
